### Step 1
Generate the bandit dataset per the instructions on the Supervised Pretraining paper.
### Step 2
Train the value network and policy network per Algorithm 2 of the GoFAR paper.
### Step 3
With the trained policy network model M_\theta(Â·|s_h, D), conduct experiments per Algorithm 3 and 4 of the Supervised Pretraining paper.
